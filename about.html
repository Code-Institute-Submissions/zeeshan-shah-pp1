                    <p>
                        Ice Ville is a highly respected brand in the American ice cream industry and is known for unsurpassed quality and taste. With its roots in Iowa, Ice Ville has played an important role in establishing Le Mars as American ice cream capital.
                    </p> 
                    <p> 
                        Ice Ville was founded in 1953 and our brand had a humble beginning in the form of an ice cream parlour. Based on the principles of quality, taste, innovation, and affordability, we have become one of the most popular and valuable brands in the following 70 years. 
                    </p> 
                    <p>  
                        Quality is sacred to our organization and anchored in the organizational culture. Since customer satisfaction is our focus, we strive in every way to ensure that every ice cream from our state-of-the-art production facility radiates outstanding quality. Therefore, we are a benchmark for quality and taste in the American ice cream industry.

                            <p>Our milk has a high percentage of butterfat, which allows us to produce a "super premium" ice cream! Super Premium means you get more of the good stuff (butterfat) and less air, with no fillers or conditioners. Our milk is free of antibiotics and synthetic growth hormones. It's super fresh! It only takes 24 hours for our dairy to reach our dairy from the farms!</p>

                            <p>Making high quality cream is not without its challenges. It is a sensitive product requiring gentle and correct processing. We understand this process very well, and can provide you with sophisticated equipment to extract the precise fat content required.</p>

                            <p>While taste is a very personal matter, the purity of taste is considered important by many. With that in mind, flavors should be both easily identifiable and “natural/pure” and not muddled or artificial. Flavors should also not be overly "falsified" (fruit flavors robbed of their freshness by too much added sugar being a case in point). We therefore firmly believe in creating pure and organic flavors that make us love them.</p>
